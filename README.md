### FlashCards 

# Abstract
This project is the first solo project of Module 2. This is the first time writing tests and implementing ES6. In this project, I wrote a program that simulates a set of flash cards through the command line.
A user will be able to see the questions, take guesses, and see a final score at the end of the round.

## Setup
Fork and clone this [repo](https://github.com/Devynnem/flashcards).

Install the library dependencies. Run:

```npm install```

To verify that it is setup correctly, run ```npm test``` in your terminal.

Running ```node index.js``` from the root of your project will make the game playable!

You can select an answer prompt by using the arrows to move up and down the selected choices, or select a number. Hit enter once your chosen answer is highlighted.

You will be prompted for each question, have the opportunity to select an answer, and will be given feedback. You will be able to play through the entire deck of cards:

## Reflections:

This is the first project I have done where I was unable to visualize in the momemnt if what I was doing was correct. Even when I would write the tests first, and then write the code to see if it worked, and the tests passed, I still was not sure if I was on the right track. Leaning on the other students to ask questions and see if I was on track was very helpful. 

## Technologies Used:
